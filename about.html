   Welcome to Bamboom! A society of panda-lovers that strive to restore the homes of these lovely and invaluable furries

<h1>Who are we?</h1>

<p>BAMBOOM is a startup organization whose goal is to raise money for the conservation of giant pandas.
</p>
<h1>
Why save the pandas?
</h1>

<p>Pandas are endangered species who are declining in numbers due to habitat loss, hunting, hidden animal traps and bamboo reduction. In 2014, there were only 1864 wild giant pandas counted in a survey. Two-thirds of this population and their existing habitat are safeguarded in 67 panda reserves in China. In addition, the beloved Asian mammal play a crucial role in China’s bamboo forests by spreading seeds and helping the vegetation to grow.
</p>

<h1>
Who are our affiliates?
</h1>
<p>Currently, we are partnered with the one of the largest conservation organizations, WWF. Panda conservation is only one project of thousands they’ve founded.
</p>
